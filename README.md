Quick and dirty:

  Traveling salesman problem solved using an abridged version of the genetic algorithm.

  The solution can certainly be coded better, it is simply the case that I was trying to throw something together for the public
to see in a web-accessible medium.  And no, I wouldn't typically block nodejs with a CPU-intensive task.  Thanks, bye.
